3. **Perimeter and Area of a Rectangle**
   - Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle and calculates its perimeter and area.
   - Formula:

     Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
     Area = length * width

   - Input: `Length = 5, Width = 3`
   - Output: 

     Perimeter: 16
     Area: 15


4. **Simple Interest Calculation**
   - Write a program that calculates simple interest using the formula:

     Simple Interest = (P * T * R) / 100

     where `P` is the principal amount, `T` is time in years, and `R` is the rate of interest.
   - Input: `P = 1000, T = 5, R = 10`
   - Output: `Simple Interest: 500`

5. **Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit)**
   - Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:

     F = (C * 9/5) + 32

   - Input: `Celsius = 25`
   - Output: `Fahrenheit: 77`

6. **Swapping Two Numbers Using a Temporary Variable**
   - Write a C program that swaps the values of two variables using a temporary variable.
   
   - Input: `a = 3, b = 8`
   
   - Output: 
     Before Swap: a = 3, b = 8
     After Swap: a = 8, b = 3
